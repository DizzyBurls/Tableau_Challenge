# Tableau_Challenge

By Chris Burley

I have decided to focus on phenomena occuring in the Jersey City region of New York.
I thought analysing a 'branch' of the Citi Bike business would be of interest to stakeholders.

Please finding the following in this repository:

(1) A 'Resources' folder which houses all of the raw data from the Citi Bike website.

(2) 'Combined_Data.csv', a file which contains the cleaned and combined data that was used to create the Tableau presentation.

(3) 'Data Cleaning', a Jupyter file which shows how the Combined_Data.csv file was created.

(4) 'Homework 14', a Tableau file with the final presentation (story), slides and dashboards in it.

(5) 'Slide_Descriptions.txt', a file which contains analysis of each slide in the presentation.
